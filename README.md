## Playover 

### Background: 
Alaska Airlines Flight attendant of 32 years is tired of the traditional methods of gathering the contact info of each of 4 flight-attendants and 2 pilots. Contact info is necessary in emergency situations and sudden flight/itinerary changes. Currently, every time a crew member begins a trip, he/she must write down or enter into their phone the contact information of fellow crew members. Most often, this occurs at the layover location but could take place during the flight. Generally, info gathered includes phone numbers and sometimes hotel room numbers. This obviously seems to be a possible security risk.

### Problems: 
Possible security issues
Crew changes every single day, sometimes multiple times
You’re soon stuck with hundreds of unknown contacts in your phone
You can’t avoid it; you need to be in touch with crewmembers 
Typos can ruin everything

### Solutions
Using location services share contact info with members in your organization near you. How: Create a profile with the information you want to share, open the app, (when you either get onboard or check in at the hotel) and find those in your crew.
